How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because it was working in the old version. Must have gone wrong somewhere

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see the development. Bug fixes and stuff.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    We can keep track of features and bug fixes in git but can forget.
    But for verions automatically saved, we can't keep track and use commit
    messages but won't need to remember when to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Becuase git is designed for maintaining versions of code while google docs
    is designed for documents which don't depend on each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use git (with or without --stat parameter) log to see all the commit history. Then compare the
    differences using git diff -u old_file_uuid new_fild_uuid

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you know you can revert back anytime ;)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
