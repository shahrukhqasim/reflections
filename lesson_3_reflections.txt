When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For sharing!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So if someone else is working on the project, we might get conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: For clone someonee else's work.
    Clone: Well its the superset
    Branches: For different features etc or bug fixes or merges

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    For example, helps in merging. And you can know how many commits are you
    ahead.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
